    <h4>
      This is my progress log in the coding world. I'm really excited.<br />
      First, let me start telling you my objetives and a little bit of my
      history: I really love computers. Since I was a child I would open old
      devices to try to fix them (of course i only managed do kill any hope of
      restoring the devices rsrsrs) but yes, that was me pretty much my whole
      childhood. <br />
      Then the Covid-19 pandemia came, I was 15 years old with no laptop, so my
      father game me his old laptop. It as an amazing feeling. I filled it with
      stickers right away ahahahah. But here's the problem: It was a 15 years
      old acer with 2 GB RAM, and I needed to be able to use Microsoft 365 on
      this old loved junk. So that was when I started to dig into the software
      world, trying to find ways to make the laptop faster, trying to make it
      work, and of course, I tried to install The Sims 2 (I dont even have to
      mention that it was imposible to run the game). <br />
      Since then, all I've done was try to know machines better. The softwares,
      the hardwares. I'm a curious person, so I've opened every single laptop
      that I could. And also, I destroid pretty much every door mechanism of my
      house just to mount then again (that's probably why my parents and grandma
      resent me... rs)
      <br />
      Soon I became the nerd friend that everyone sends mensages when the HDMI
      cable of their house stop working. Even tho much of the time I help people
      with simple tasks, It is still rewarding. <br />
      After 3 years on a Journalism degree, I came in terms with myself, and
      accepted that this is not what I want. I want my coo-worker being a PC not
      a stuborn person. That's why I decided to learn programming by myself. I
      know that it won't be easy, but every progress I make is a joy, and I want
      to share with you guys.
